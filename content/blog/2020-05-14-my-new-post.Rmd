Some lovely python

```{python}
print("hello world")
```

Python 'if/else' statements allow you to categorize a string in a variety of ways. Below, given the string "Failure is a bruise, not a tatoo" python can evaluate whether or not the character meets the criteria for each statement. If it meets the criteria, python will go to the next indented statement (print out a statement about the string), and if not it will move down to the next line to evaluate if the string meets those characteristics, and so on. 
```{python}
s = "Failure is a bruise, not a tatoo" 
if len(s) < 10:
 print(s, "is shorter than 10 characters")
elif len(s) < 20:
 print(s, "is shorter than 20 characters")
else: 
 print(s, "is 20+ characters")
```

You can also create functions in python that can be applied to multiple strings. The function below will count characters for the given sentence below. 
```{python}
def count_chars(sentence): 
 counts = {} 
 for c in sentence: 
  if c in counts: 
    counts[c]+=1 
  else:
    counts[c]=1 
 
 for c in counts:
    print(c, "appears", counts[c],"times")



new_sentence = "Failure is a bruise, not a tatoo"
count_chars(new_sentence)
```
